# 👾 POTTS BOT - A New Discord Bot 👾

In this folder you can find all the available commands and how they are being called.

## Commands
As you see, there are a few commands you can use: `!help, !apa <string url>, !convert <string place1> <string place2>, !fortune, !meme, !qr <string url>, !shell <string question>, !status <string url>`<br>

If you want to update/add the functionality of any command, you just have to follow the content of the document.<br>

`name: myName` This is the command's name you will need to execute from Discord.<br>
`description: any description` This field indicates a description of what is the command for. <br>
`execute(message, args)` This function contains the logic of each specific command, inside it, we use a async-await function that is auto-called to be executed immediately. <br>

Finally, you can see the necessary variables you may need during the process.
